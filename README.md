# VaryLaTeX

How to submit a research paper, a technical report, a grant proposal , or a curriculum vitae that respect imposed constraints such as formatting instructions and page limits? It is a challenging task, especially when coping with time pressure.

VaryLaTeX is a solution based on variability, constraint programming , and machine learning techniques for documents written in LaTeX to meet constraints and deliver on time. 

As a user, you simply have to annotate LaTeX source files with variability information, e.g., (de)activating portions of text, tuning figures' sizes, or tweaking line spacing. Then, a fully automated procedure learns constraints among Boolean and numerical values for avoiding non-acceptable paper variants, and finally, users can further configure their papers (e.g., aesthetic considerations) or pick a (random) paper variant that meets constraints, e.g., page limits. 



More details can be found in the following paper, published/presented at 12th International Workshop on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems https://vamos2018.wordpress.com/:
